# Conversion Copy Standards for AI SaaS Landing Pages

This document defines high-performing copy patterns for AI SaaS products where trust, differentiation, and clarity determine conversion.

## 1) Value Proposition Architecture

### Core formula
- Audience + job-to-be-done + measurable outcome + differentiator + confidence signal.

Example structure:
- "For [audience], [product] helps you [outcome] in [timeframe], using [differentiator], trusted by [proof]."

### Standard
- Hero copy must include outcome and intended user.
- Differentiator must be specific (workflow, speed, quality, governance, integration depth).
- Avoid empty adjectives without evidence.

## 2) Headline Pattern Library

### Pattern A: Outcome without pain
- "Ship [result] without [major friction]."

### Pattern B: Speed-to-value
- "Go from [input] to [output] in [time bound]."

### Pattern C: Role-specific promise
- "Built for [role] to [critical job] with less [cost/risk/time]."

### Pattern D: Confidence-led
- "Production-ready [category] with [security/governance/proof]."

Use one dominant headline pattern per page variant.

## 3) Subheadline and Support Copy Standards

### Standard
- Subheadline explains how promise is delivered.
- Clarify model behavior limits when necessary.
- Include context that reduces skepticism (speed benchmark, reliability statement, setup expectations).

### Red flags
- Restating headline with synonyms.
- Technical jargon replacing user outcome clarity.

## 4) CTA Copy System

### Primary CTA patterns
- "Start free"
- "Try with sample prompt"
- "Generate my first [artifact]"
- "Start building"

### Secondary CTA patterns
- "Watch 2-minute demo"
- "See real outputs"
- "Talk to sales"

### Standard
- CTA text describes immediate next action, not vague intent.
- Risk-reversal appears near CTA (no card required, cancel anytime, sandbox available).
- CTA variants align with funnel mode (self-serve vs enterprise).

## 5) Proof and Credibility Copy

### Proof types in priority order
- Quantified outcomes (with context).
- Named customer proof (role/company/outcome).
- Third-party credibility (awards, analyst mentions, partner ecosystem).
- Operational trust signals (security/compliance/uptime).

### Standard
- Every major claim has adjacent proof.
- Proof statements are concrete and falsifiable.

### Red flags
- "Trusted by leading teams" without names or numbers.
- Outdated metrics without timeframe.

## 6) Objection-Handling Copy Blocks

Address these explicitly for AI SaaS:
- Accuracy and hallucination concern.
- Data privacy and model training concern.
- Integration and migration concern.
- Pricing predictability concern.
- Team adoption and change-management concern.

### Standard
- Objection copy appears before final CTA.
- Responses are short, concrete, and link to deeper details.

## 7) Pricing and Packaging Language Standards

### Standard
- Clarify what scales with price: seats, usage, models, automation limits.
- Explain overage behavior and guardrails.
- Clearly separate self-serve and enterprise paths.

### Red flags
- "Contact us" only, with no qualification context.
- Hidden constraints discovered after signup.

## 8) Differentiation vs Competitors

### Standard
- Compare on buyer-relevant dimensions:
1. Quality of output
2. Reliability and control
3. Integration depth
4. Governance and security
5. Total cost/time to value

### Red flags
- "Better than X" with no scenario proof.
- Feature-count comparisons without outcome impact.

## 9) Tone and Brand Voice for AI Products

### Recommended tone traits
- Competent
- Transparent
- Practical
- Evidence-backed

### Avoid
- Overhyped futurism that weakens trust.
- Absolutes like "perfect" or "always accurate".

## 10) Copy QA Checklist Before Release

A page is copy-ready when:
- Hero promise is specific and role-aligned.
- Primary CTA and next step are unambiguous.
- Top objections are addressed in visible sections.
- Claims are supported with verifiable proof.
- Risk and limitations are communicated responsibly.
- Enterprise buyers can find security/procurement path quickly.

Scoring rubric (0-3 each):
- Clarity
- Specificity
- Proof strength
- Differentiation
- Risk reduction
- Actionability

Interpretation:
- 0-7: major rewrite required.
- 8-12: baseline exists, still weak.
- 13-16: strong conversion-ready copy.
- 17-18: best-in-class candidate.
