### ❗ Problem

Security operations teams struggle to quickly and accurately detect complex threat patterns in logs in real time.

### 💡 Solution

This project uses a conditional agent pipeline (via LangGraph + LLMs) to automatically route logs through specialized analyzers and produce interpretable threat assessments.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** for REST log ingestion  
- **LangGraph & OpenRouter/OpenAI** for agent workflows
- **Streamlit** for interactive visualization
- **Pandas & Plotly** for analytics and charts

### ✨ Features

- Autonomous log analysis with dynamic routing
- Conditional branching & retry logic for deep inspection
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard with risk visualizations
- Mock server for realistic test logs
