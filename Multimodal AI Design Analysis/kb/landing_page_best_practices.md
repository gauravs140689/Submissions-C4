# Landing Page Audit Standards for AI SaaS

This guide is optimized for prompt-first AI SaaS products (for example: coding assistants, agent builders, AI workspaces, and copilots). It is written as an audit rubric for product managers and designers.

## 1) Strategic Clarity Above the Fold

### Required outcomes in first 5 seconds
- User can answer all three questions without scrolling:
1. What is this product?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why is it better than alternatives?

### Standard
- Headline states concrete outcome, not just capability.
- Subheadline clarifies audience + primary job-to-be-done.
- One primary CTA is visually dominant.
- Secondary CTA supports evaluation behavior (for example: "Watch demo" or "View example").
- Hero visual demonstrates real product behavior, not abstract illustration only.

### Red flags
- Generic AI claims like "Supercharge productivity" without proof.
- Multiple equally weighted CTAs competing in hero.
- Animated visuals that distract from core action.

## 2) AI SaaS Information Architecture Blueprint

### Recommended section order
- Hero (outcome + primary action)
- Prompt-to-result demo (how it works in 3 steps)
- Use cases by persona/job
- Trust proof (logos, outcomes, testimonials)
- Product depth (integrations, collaboration, governance)
- Pricing/packaging signal
- FAQ and objection handling
- Final conversion block

### Standard
- Each section has one core message and one user action.
- Section transitions answer progressive buyer questions:
1. "What is it?"
2. "Will it work for me?"
3. "Can I trust it?"
4. "How much effort/cost/risk?"

## 3) Prompt-First UX Expectations

### Standard
- Prompt input is visible early and clearly actionable.
- Placeholder/example prompt teaches quality input behavior.
- Demo states expected output format and typical latency.
- Empty-state guidance reduces first-action anxiety.
- Prompt examples map to top user intents.

### Red flags
- Prompt box looks interactive but is non-functional without clear label.
- No examples, causing users to guess what to type.
- Demo is polished but unrealistic versus product output quality.

## 4) Trust Architecture for AI Products

### Trust signals required
- Customer logos relevant to target segment.
- Outcome proof with metric + baseline context.
- Social proof quality: named role/company when possible.
- Security/compliance posture (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, data policy links where applicable).
- Reliability signals (uptime, SLA, model transparency, status page).

### Standard
- Trust claims appear near high-intent decision points (hero CTA, pricing CTA, form submit).
- Proof is specific, recent, and verifiable.

### Red flags
- Unqualified superlatives ("best", "#1") without substantiation.
- Trust badges shown without linked details.

## 5) Conversion System Standards

### CTA system
- Exactly one primary CTA per screen region.
- CTA text describes user outcome after click.
- Risk-reversal microcopy is visible near high-friction actions.

### Form standards
- Ask minimum fields for first conversion.
- Explain why sensitive fields are requested.
- Progressive profiling preferred over long first form.

### Pricing and packaging clarity
- Users can infer entry cost and upgrade logic quickly.
- Distinguish seat limits, usage limits, and model access clearly.
- Enterprise path is explicit (security, procurement, SSO, governance).

## 6) Enterprise Readiness Signals (B2B AI SaaS)

### Standard
- Integration ecosystem is visible (Slack, GitHub, Google Workspace, etc. where relevant).
- Admin/governance capabilities are discoverable (roles, audit logs, data controls).
- Procurement confidence signals included (security docs, legal contacts, DPA process).

### Red flags
- Product appears "prosumer only" for enterprise buyers.
- Missing migration/import story for switching costs.

## 7) Visual Hierarchy and Interaction Quality

### Standard
- Clear typographic hierarchy (headline, support copy, metadata).
- High contrast between primary CTA and surrounding elements.
- Scannable layout with predictable rhythm and spacing.
- Motion is purposeful and does not block comprehension.

### Red flags
- Dense text blocks above fold.
- Overuse of gradients/noise reducing readability.
- Carousels for critical proof content.

## 8) Mobile and Performance Expectations

### Mobile standard
- Primary value proposition and CTA visible without excessive scrolling.
- Prompt and form controls are thumb-friendly.
- No horizontal overflow; all critical interactions remain usable.

### Performance standard
- Fast first meaningful render on common mobile networks.
- Heavy media deferred or optimized.
- Skeleton/loading states explain waiting behavior.

## 9) Comparison and Benchmarking Rules

When comparing multiple designs, score each design across these dimensions:
- Value proposition clarity
- Prompt-first usability
- Trust and proof quality
- Conversion friction
- Accessibility readiness
- Enterprise readiness

Use a 0-3 scale per dimension:
- 0: Missing or harmful
- 1: Present but weak/ambiguous
- 2: Good and usable
- 3: Excellent and defensible

## 10) Definition of "Design Ready for Experiment"

A landing page is ready for A/B experimentation when:
- Outcome + audience + differentiator are explicit above fold.
- Primary CTA path is unambiguous.
- At least one credible trust block appears before deep scroll.
- Pricing/risk expectations are visible.
- Accessibility and readability pass basic checks.
