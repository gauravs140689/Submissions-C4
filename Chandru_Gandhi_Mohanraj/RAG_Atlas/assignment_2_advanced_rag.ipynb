        "- Learn different response synthesis strategies (TreeSummarize, Refine)\n",
        "- Create structured outputs using Pydantic models\n",
        "- Build advanced retrieval pipelines with multiple processing stages\n",

Specific benchmarks may focus on particular environments or tasks to determine how well agents can generalize to new situations. Additionally, human evaluation is often required for more nuanced or subjective measures, such as tool use efficiency and planning robustness.
